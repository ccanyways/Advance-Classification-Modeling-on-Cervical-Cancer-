# Advance-Classification-Modeling-on-Cervical-Cancer-
The goal of our project is to find the relationship between cervical cancer and some other factors that have some influence on the occurrence of cervical cancer. We found a dataset on Kaggle in order to support our willingness and help us to find if cervical cancer definitely has some causes that are shown in our dataset.  The process that leads to our conclusion includes first data preparation. In this procedure, we read the data and display some descriptions of the data. We deal with the problem of missing value and some necessary steps. One thing to note is that we used the Knn technique to handle the missing values, so that way would be better compared to just replacing with the means or zero. We then normalized the data, so in this way, our data looks standard and easy to handle.   As for our main parts of the project, we did some analysis related to different techniques in machine learning in order to explore the data. We did K-means clustering as our unsupervised learning and some supervised learnings like KNN, decision tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes and Support Vector machine. We also used the PCA method in K-means clustering to make the dimension lower and easy to use, and Logistic regression before PCA &amp; after PCA comparison.
